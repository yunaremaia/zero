// THE LAUNCH FACT HAS TO SURVIVE EVERY RESULT SHAPE, NOT JUST THE CAPTURED ONE.
//
// exec_command builds its outcome through its own conversion rather than through
// Runner.ExecuteCaptured, and that conversion used to assert `launched = true` on
// the grounds that a start failure returns earlier. That reasoning holds for the
// process the tool starts, and on Windows a wrapped plan starts the sandbox
// helper: the requested child is created inside it, after marker, ACL, network,
// SID and token setup, any of which can fail with the helper already running.
// Asserting the launch there tells the operator that reads were denied in
// exchange for the write jail when nothing ran under that enforcement.
//
// The retained shape is the one worth pinning hardest: exec_command can return a
// running session before the helper has even attempted the inner launch, so an
// absent report there means "not yet", not "yes".
