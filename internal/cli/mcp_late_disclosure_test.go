// A LAUNCH THAT COMPLETES AFTER THE REPORTER HAS RUN MUST STILL BE SAID, ONCE,
// AND ONLY WHILE SOMEONE OWNS THE WRITER.
//
// Both production paths call reportMCPStartupDisclosures exactly once, right
// after RegisterTools returns. A stdio attempt abandoned at the connect timeout
// can still be inside cmd.Start at that moment; the process then starts under
// the reduced write confinement, the reaper closes its client, and a reporter
// that merely SAMPLED the runtime has already come and gone. The retained sink
// held the fact and nobody read it again, so the operator saw the skipped
// server and never the disclosure.
//
// This drives the REAL reporter against a REAL runtime, rather than polling
// StartupDisclosures by hand, which is what an earlier regression did and which
// is precisely how it masked the original bug: a test that re-reads on the
// tester's behalf proves nothing about a production path that does not.
//
// It also never reads stderr while the pump could write. The buffer is examined
// only after stop has joined the pump, which is the same discipline both
// production callers follow, and is why this passes under -race.
